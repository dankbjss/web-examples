<h2>All the Colours of the Rainbow</h2>
<p>This is just an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> of type 'color'. No canvas, it's browser native, and you can
    even select a colour that is on the page, which can't be done with a JavaScript approach.</p>
<div class="centred-row">
    <label for="colour">Pick a colour: <input type="color" id="colour"></label>

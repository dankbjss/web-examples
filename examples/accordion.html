<h2>Accordion To Some</h2>
<p>This is the HTML native <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag combined with the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>
    tag for the heading</p>
<details>
    <summary>Click me to open or close</summary>
    <p>This is a heck of a lot of text you might not want displayed by default. If you do want it displayed
        by default you can add the <code>open</code> property to the details tag and it will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>A smidgen of CSS has been added to the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag to make it clear when you
        hover over it that it can be interacted with.</p>

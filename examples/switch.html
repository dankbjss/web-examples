<h2>Switch it Up</h2>
<p>A modern approach to the switch with piddly
    <sup class="footnote" _="on click get the next <details/> then toggle @open on it">[1]</sup> JS is used to
    toggle bewteen light and dark mode in. This replicates the switch type that is currently only availabe in safari,
    but hopefully will be added to other browsers soon.

        <sup>[1]</sup> This switch does use a bit of JavaScript to set dark or light mode, but it comes to less
        than 14 lines. It is possible to toggle darkmode on or off with only css as per Coding2GO's video.
        This implementation, while requiing some code, checks if the user has a preference for darkmode and
        defaults the page accordingly while still allowing the user to flip between light and dark.

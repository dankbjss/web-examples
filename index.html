            <h3>JavaScript Out, CSS & HTML In</h3>
            <p>JavaScript frameworks are great. They allow you to create web apps with rich functionality, but at the
                cost of having to learn the ins and outs of how that framework implements that functionality, all
                the while bloating your project with tonnes of packages.</p>
            <p>We go to frameworks because they allow us to build complex components. But many of these 'complex'
                components can be built with just the Holy Trinity&#8482; of web develeopment (HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript). A lot of the time you don't even need JavaScript.</p>
            <p>These components are mainly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP_rtWEMR0o"
                    target="_blank">this</a> talk by Kilian Valkhof and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3Odw-k8W4" target="_blank">this</a> video by the youtuber
                Coding2GO, but also other places across the web where I've been able to take inspiriation<sup>*</sup>
                from others.
            </p>
            <p><sup>*</sup> Read: nicked. I've tried to credit where I've taken inspiration from, but if I've missed
                something please let me know.</p>

            <h3>Switch it Up</h3>
            <p>A modern approach to the switch with no JavaScript. This replicates the switch type that is currently
                only availabe in safari, but hopefully will be added to other browsers soon.</p>
            <div class="centred-column">
                <label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="switch" />
                    Dark Mode<sup>*</sup>
                </label>
            </div>
            <p><sup>*</sup> This switch does use a bit of JavaScript to set dark or light mode, but it comes to less
                than 14 lines. It is possible to toggle darkmode on or off with only css as per Coding2GO's video.
                This implementation, while requiing some code, checks if the user has a preference for darkmode and
                defaults the page accordingly while still allowing the user to flip between light and dark.</p>

            <h3>HTML, you Autocomplete Me</h3>
            <p>An autocomplete input using only HTML, specifically the <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> tag</p>
            <div class="centred-column">
                <input type="text" list="my-list" />
                <datalist id="my-list">
                    <option>apples</option>

        <section class="card">
            <h3>All the Colours of the Rainbow</h3>
            <p>This is just an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> of type 'color'. No canvas, it's browser native, and you can
                even select a colour that is on the page, which can't be done with a JavaScript approach.</p>
            <div class="centred-row">
                <label for="coloru">Pick a colour: <input type="color" id="colour"></label>

        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h3>Accordion To Some</h3>
            <p>This is the HTML native <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag combined with the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>
                tag for the heading</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Click me to open or close</summary>
                <p>This is a heck of a lot of text you might not want displayed by default. If you do want it displayed
                    by default you can add the <code>open</code> property to the details tag and it will be displayed.
                </p>
                <p>A smidgen of CSS has been added to the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag to make it clear when you
                    hover over it that it can be interacted with.</p>
            </details>

            <h3>Dropdown with the Sickness</h3>
            <p>You can make a dropdown menu without JavaScript, and there are multiple ways to do this. IN this instance
                I'm making use of an <code>&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</code> element. This can also be achieved with
                an
                <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag as you can see <a href="https://codepen.io/markcaron/pen/wdVmpB"
                    target="_blank">here</a> (which is where I lifted the example from).

            <h3>Start a Dialog</h3>
            <p> This is a native HTML element <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code>. This does require a bit of JavaScript to make
                use of the dialog api, but significantly less than a framework or package would make you use.</p>

            <h3>Size Doesn't Matter</h3>
            <p>With <code>resize</code> you can make any inline element for which the <code>overflow</code> property

            <h3>Making The Gradient</h3>
            <p>With the <code>linear-gradient</code> property you can make a gradient background for any element. This
                usually doesn't work with text, but when combined with <code>background-clip: text</code> and
                <code>color: transparent</code> you can make headings that will break your eyes.
